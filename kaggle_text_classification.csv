"A kangaroo is a marsupial from the family Macropodidae (macropods, meaning 'large foot'",0
" In common use the term is used to describe the largest species from this family, the Red Kangaroo, the Antilopine Kangaroo, and the Eastern and Western Grey Kangaroo of the Macropus genus",0
" The family also includes many smaller species which include the wallabies, tree-kangaroos, wallaroos, pademelons and the Quokka, some 63 living species in all",0
"  Kangaroos are endemic to the continent of Australia, while the smaller macropods are found in Australia and New Guinea",0
" They are not farmed to any extent, but wild kangaroos are shot for meat, over which there is controversy",0

"  Etymology of mammal names URL accessed January 7, 2007",0
"  The name was first recorded as ""Kangooroo or Kanguru"" on 4 August,1770, by Lieutenant (later Captain) James Cook on the banks of the Endeavour River at the site of modern Cooktown, when HM Bark Endeavour was beached for almost seven weeks to repair damage sustained on the Great Barrier Reef",0
""" According to this legend, Captain James Cook and naturalist Sir Joseph Banks were exploring Australia when they happened upon the animal",0
 They asked a nearby local what the creatures were called,0
" The local responded ""Kangaroo"", meaning ""I don't understand you"", which Cook took to be the name of the creature",0
"  Male kangaroos are called bucks, boomers, jacks, or old men; females are does, flyers, or jills, and the young ones are joeys",0
"  Animal Bytes: Kangaroo and Wallaby URL accessed January 7, 2007",0
"  The collective noun for kangaroos is a mob, troop, or court",0
 Kangaroos are sometimes colloquially referred to as roos,0
" Fewer in numbers, the Red Kangaroo occupies the arid and semi-arid centre of the continent",0
 A large male can be 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) tall and weigh 90 kg (200 lb),0
" It is found in the southern part of Western Australia, South Australia near the coast, and the Darling River basin",0
" Like them, it is a creature of the grassy plains and woodlands, and gregarious",0
" Early explorers described them as creatures that had heads like deer (without antlers), stood upright like men, and hopped like frogs",0
"  Combined with the two-headed appearance of a mother kangaroo, this led many back home to dismiss them as travellers' tales for quite some time",0
" Like all marsupials, female kangaroos have a pouch called a marsupium in which joeys complete postnatal development",0
" The comfortable hopping speed for Red Kangaroo is about 20 25 km/h (13 16 mph), but speeds of up to 70 km/h (44 mph) can be attained, over short distances, while it can sustain a speed of 40 km/h (25 mph) for  nearly two kilometres",0
"    This fast and energy-efficient method of travel has evolved because of the need to regularly cover large distances in search of food and water, rather than the need to escape predators",0
" To move at slow speeds, it uses its tail to form a tripod with its two forelimbs",0
" It then raises its hind feet forward, in a form of locomotion called ""crawl-walking",0
  Eastern grey kangaroos are predominantly grazers eating a wide variety of grasses whereas some other species (e,0
 red kangaroos and swamp wallabies) include significant amounts of shrubs in the diet,0
 The smaller species of kangaroos also consume hypogeal fungi,0
"  Many species are nocturnal  Archives URL accessed January 7, 2007",0
"  and crepuscular,  Columbus Zoo article URL accessed January 7, 2007",0
"  usually spending the days resting in shade and the cool evenings, nights and mornings moving about and feeding",0
" Its incisors are able to crop grass close to the ground, and its molars chop and grind the grass",0
" Since the two sides of the lower jaw are not joined together, the lower incisors are farther apart, giving the kangaroo a wider bite",0
" The silica in grass is abrasive, so kangaroo molars move forward as they are ground down, and eventually fall out, replaced by new teeth that grow in the back",0
" The hydrogen byproduct of fermentation is instead converted into acetate, which is then used to provide further energy",0
" Scientists are interested in the possibility of transferring the bacteria responsible from kangaroos to cattle, since the greenhouse gas effect of methane is 23 times greater than that of carbon dioxide",0
"  Radio Australia - Innovations: 
 ""Methane In Agriculture",0
" The Thylacine, considered by palaeontologists to have once been a major natural predator of the kangaroo, is now extinct",0
" Other extinct predators included the Marsupial Lion, Megalania and the Wonambi",0
" However, with the arrival of humans in Australia at least 50,000 years ago and the introduction of the dingo about 5,000 years ago, kangaroos have had to adapt",0
   The mere barking of a dog can set a full-grown male boomer into a wild frenzy,0
   Wedge-tailed Eagles and other raptors usually eat kangaroo carrion,0
 Goannas and other carnivorous reptiles also pose a danger to smaller kangaroo species when other food sources are lacking,0
" Kangaroos and wallabies are adept swimmers, and often flee into waterways if presented with the option",0
" If pursued into the water, a large kangaroo may use its forepaws to hold the predator underwater so as to drown it",0
"  Canadian Museum of Nature - Kangaroo URL accessed January 6, 2007",0
  Another defensive tactic described by witnesses is catching the attacking dog  with the forepaws and disembowelling it with the hind legs,0
" As with all marsupials, the young are born at a very early stage of development   after a gestation of 31 36 days",0
" At this stage, only the forelimbs are somewhat developed, to allow the newborn to climb to the pouch and attach to a teat",0
" In comparison, a human embryo at a similar stage of development would be about seven weeks old, and premature babies born at less than 23 weeks are usually not mature enough to survive",0
 The joey will usually stay in the pouch for about nine months (180 320 days for the Western Grey) before starting to leave the pouch for small periods of time,0
 It is usually fed by its mother until reaching 18 months,0
" This is known as diapause, and will occur in times of drought and in areas with poor food sources",0
  The composition of the milk produced by the mother varies according to the needs of the joey,0
" In addition, the mother is able to produce two different kinds of milk simultaneously for the newborn and the older joey still in the pouch",0
" They store elastic strain energy in the tendons of their large hind legs, providing most of the energy required for each hop by the spring action of the tendons rather than by any muscular effort",0
" This is true in all animal species which have muscles connected to their skeleton through elastic elements such as tendons, but the effect is more pronounced in kangaroos",0
" Studies of kangaroos and wallabies have demonstrated that, beyond the minimum energy expenditure required to hop at all, increased speed requires very little extra effort (much less than the same speed increase in, say, a horse, dog or human), and that the extra energy is required to carry extra weight",0
" For kangaroos, the key benefit of hopping is not speed to escape predators the top speed of a kangaroo is no higher than that of a similarly-sized quadruped, and the Australian native predators are in any case less fearsome than those of other continents but economy: in an infertile continent with highly variable weather patterns, the ability of a kangaroo to travel long distances at moderately high speed in search of food sources is crucial to survival",0
"
 
 A sequencing project of the Kangaroo genome was started in 2004 as a collaboration between Australia (mainly funded by the state of Victoria) and the National Institutes of Health in the US",0
"  Kangaroo hops in line for genome sequencing URL accessed January 6, 2007",0
"  The genome of a marsupial such as the kangaroo is of great interest to scientists studying comparative genomics because marsupials are at an ideal degree of evolutionary divergence from humans: mice are too close and haven't developed many different functions, while birds are genetically too remote",0
 The dairy industry has also expressed some interest in this project,0
"
 
 
 
 Eye disease  is rare but not new among kangaroos",0
"  The first official report of kangaroo blindness took place in 1994, in central New South Wales",0
"  The following year, reports of blind kangaroos appeared in Victoria and South Australia",0
"  By 1996, the disease had spread ""across the desert to Western Australia""",0
  Australian authorities were concerned that the disease could spread to other livestock and possibly humans,0
"  Researchers at the Australian Animal Health Laboratories in Geelong detected a virus called the Wallal virus in two species of midge, believed to have been the carriers",0
       Veterinarians also discovered that less than three percent of kangaroos exposed to the virus developed blindness,0
"
 
 
 
 Before European settlement, the kangaroo was a very important animal for Australian Aborigines, for its meat, hide, bones and sinews",0
" In addition, there were important Dreaming stories and ceremonies involving the kangaroo",0
  Aherrenge is a current kangaroo dreaming site in the Northern Territory,0
 The game of Marn grook was played using a ball made from kangaroo  by the Kurnai people,0
"
 
 Unlike many of the smaller macropods, kangaroos have fared well since European settlement",0
" European settlers cut down forests to create vast grasslands for sheep and cattle grazing, added stock watering points in arid areas, and have substantially reduced the number of dingoes",0
"
 
 Kangaroos are shy and retiring by nature, and in normal circumstances present no threat to humans",0
" Male kangaroos often ""box"" amongst each other, playfully, for dominance, or in competition for mates",0
" The dexterity of their forepaws is utilised in both punching and grappling with the foe, but the real danger lies in a serious kick with the hindleg",0
 The sharpened toenails can disembowel an opponent,0
"
 
 There are very few records of kangaroos attacking humans without provocation, however several such unprovoked attacks in 2004 spurred fears of a rabies-like disease possibly affecting the marsupials",0
" The only reliably documented case of a fatality from a kangaroo attack occurred in New South Wales, in 1936",0
 A hunter was killed when he tried to rescue his two dogs from a heated fray,0
 Other suggested causes for erratic and dangerous kangaroo behaviour include extreme thirst and hunger,0

 A collision with a vehicle is capable of killing a kangaroo",0
 Kangaroos dazzled by headlights or startled by engine noise have been known to leap in front of cars,0
"  Since kangaroos in mid-bound can reach speeds of around 50 km/h (31 mph) and are relatively heavy, the force of impact can be severe",0
"  Small vehicles may be destroyed, while larger vehicles may suffer engine damage",0
 The risk of harm to vehicle occupants is greatly increased if the windscreen is the point of impact,0
"  As a result, ""kangaroo crossing"" signs are commonplace in Australia",0
"
 
 Vehicles that frequent isolated roads, where roadside assistance may be scarce, are often fitted with ""roo bars"" to minimise damage caused by collision",0
" Bonnet-mounted devices, designed to scare wildlife off the road with ultrasound and other methods, have been devised and marketed",0
"
 
 If a female is the victim of a collision, animal welfare groups ask that her pouch be checked for any surviving joey, in which case it may be removed to a wildlife sanctuary or veterinary surgeon for rehabilitation",0
"  Likewise, when an adult kangaroo is injured in a collision, a vet, the RSPCA or the National Parks and Wildlife Service can be consulted for instructions on proper care",0
" In New South Wales, rehabilitation of kangaroos is carried out by volunteers from WIRES",0
"
 
 
 
 Occasionally, individuals take on the task of rearing a recovered joey themselves",0
" The rule-of-thumb says that if the joey is already covered with fur at the time of the accident (as opposed to still being in its embryonic stage), it stands a good chance of growing up properly",0
" Lactose-free milk is required, otherwise the animal may develop blindness",0
 They hop readily into a cloth bag when it is lowered in front of them approximately to the height where the mother's pouch would be,0
" The joey's instinct is to ""cuddle up"", thereby endearing themselves to their keepers, but after hand-rearing a joey, it cannot usually be released into the wild and be expected to provide for itself immediately",0
" Usually wildlife sanctuaries are willing to adopt kangaroos which are no longer practical, or have grown too large to contain, needing at least 1 acre and 7ft boundary fences for a fully grown kangaroo",0

The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is a bear native to the Arctic,1
Polar bears and Kodiak bears are the world's largest land carnivores with most adult males weighing 300-600 kg (660-1320 lb); adult females are about half the size of males,1
Its fur is hollow and translucent but usually appears as white or cream colored thus providing the animal with effective camouflage,1
Its skin is actually black in color,1
Its thick blubber and fur insulate it against the cold,1
The bear has a short tail and small ears that help reduce heat loss as well as a relatively small head and long tapered body to streamline it for swimming,1
A semi-aquatic marine mammal the polar bear has adapted for life on a combination of land sea and ice and is the apex predator within its range,1
Polar Bears International It feeds mainly on seals young walruses and whales although it will eat anything it can kill,1
The polar bear is a vulnerable species at high risk of extinction,1
Zoologists and climatologists believe that the projected decreases in the polar sea ice due to global warming will reduce their population by two thirds by mid-century,1
Database entry includes a lengthy justification of why this species is listed as vulnerable,1
Local long-term studies show that 7 out of 19 subpopulations are declining or already severely reduced,1
See also HTML excerpts: population status reviews and Table 1 summarizing polar bear population status per 2005,1
Polar Bears and Conservation and In the USA the Center for Biological Diversity petitioned to up-list the legal conservation status of polar bears to threatened species in 2005,1
See also the Center's website on the issue,1
This petition is still under review,1
Polar bears rank with the Kodiak bear as among the largest living land carnivores and male polar bears may weigh twice as much as a Siberian tiger,1
Most adult males weigh 350 650 kg (770 1500+ lb) and measure 2,1
Stirling makes no mention of length these are from SeaWorld The great difference in body size makes the polar bear among the most sexually dimorphic of mammals surpassed only by the eared seals,1
At birth cubs weigh only 600 700 g or about a pound and a half,1
The largest polar bear on record was a huge male allegedly weighing 1002 kg (2200 lb) shot at Kotzebue Sound in northwestern Alaska in 1960,1

however unlike other Arctic mammals polar bears do not shed their coat for a darker shade to camouflage themselves in the summer habitat,1
It was once conjectured that the hollow guard hairs of a polar bear coat acted as fiber-optic tubes to conduct light to its black skin where it could be absorbed - a theory disproved by recent studies,1
An infrared image of a polarbear,1
The thick undercoat does however insulate the bears: they overheat at temperatures above 10 °C (50 °F) and are nearly invisible under infrared photography; only their breath and muzzles can be easily seen,1
When kept in captivity in warm humid conditions it is not unknown for the fur to turn a pale shade of green,1
This is due to algae growing inside the guard hairs in unusually warm conditions the hollow tubes provide an excellent home for algae,1
Whilst the algae is harmless to the bears it is often a worry to the zoos housing them and affected animals are sometimes washed in a salt solution or mild peroxide bleach to make the fur white again,1
The guard hair is 5-15 cm over most of the body of polar bears,1
However in the forelegs males have significantly longer increasing in length until 14 years of age,1
The ornamental foreleg hair is suggested as a form of an attractive trait for females likened to the lion mane,1
The polar bears ears and tail are smaller than other bears and its legs are stocky as expected from Allen's rule for a northerly animal,1
Its feet are very large however presumably to distribute load like snowshoes when walking on snow or thin ice,1
The bears sometimes have problems with various skin diseases with dermatitis caused sometimes by mites or other parasites,1
The bears are especially susceptible to Trichinella a parasitic roundworm they contract through cannibalism,1
Sometimes excess heavy metals have been observed as well as ethylene glycol (antifreeze) poisoning,1
Bears exposed to oil and petroleum products lose the insulative integrity of their coats forcing metabolic rates to dramatically increase to maintain body heat in their challenging environment,1
Bacterial Leptospirosis rabies and morbillivirus have been recorded,1
Interestingly the bears are thought by some to be more resistant than other carnivores to viral disease,1
The pollutant effect on the bears' immune systems however may end up decreasing their ability to cope with the naturally present immunological threats it encounters and in such a challenging habitat even minor weaknesses can lead to serious problems and quick death,1
The ursidae family is believed to have differentiated from other carnivora about 38 million years ago,1
The ursinae genus originated some 4 million years ago,1
According to both fossil and DNA evidence the polar bear diverged from the brown bear roughly 200 thousand years ago,1
The oldest known polar bear fossil is less than 100 thousand years old,1
Fossils show that between 10 and 20 thousand years ago the polar bear's molar teeth changed significantly from those of the brown bear,1
However more recent genetic studies have shown that some clades of Brown Bear are more closely related to polar bears than to other brown bears meaning that the polar bear is not a true species according to some species concepts,1
Otters are amphibious (or in one case aquatic) carnivorous mammals,2
The otter subfamily Lutrinae forms part of the family Mustelidae which also includes weasels polecats badgers as well as others,2
With 13 species in 7 genera otters have an almost worldwide distribution,2
An otter's den is called a holt,2
Male otters are dog-otters females are bitches and babies are cubs or pups,2
The collective noun romp is sometimes used for a group of otters being descriptive of their often playful nature,2
Otters have long slim bodies and relatively short limbs with webbed paws,2
Most have sharp claws on their feet and all but the sea otter have long muscular tails,2
They have a very soft underfur which is protected by their outer layer of long guard hair,2
This traps a layer of air and keeps them dry and warm under water,2
Otters do not depend on their specialized fur alone for survival in the cold waters where many live: they also have very high metabolic rates,2
For example Eurasian otters must eat 15% of their body-weight a day and sea otters 20 to 25% depending on the temperature,2
In water as warm as 10°C an otter needs to catch 100 g of fish per hour to survive,2
Most species hunt for 3 to 5 hours a day and nursing mothers up to 8 hours a day,2
Most otters have fish as the primary item in their diet supplemented by frogs crayfish and crabs,2
Some are expert at opening shellfish and others will take any available small mammals or birds,2
This prey-dependence leaves otters very vulnerable to prey depletion,2
Otters are very active chasing prey in the water or searching the beds of rivers lakes or the sea,2
Most species live beside water entering it mainly to hunt or travel otherwise spending much of their time on land to avoid their fur becoming waterlogged,2
The sea otter lives actually in the sea,2
Otters are playful animals for example sliding repeatedly down snowy slopes apparently from sheer enjoyment,2
Different species vary in their social structure with some being largely solitary while others live in groups   in a few species these groups may be fairy large,2
The following are short descriptions of a selection of species (see below for full list),2
The northern river otter (Lontra canadensis) became one of the major animals hunted and trapped for fur in North America after European contact,2
As one of the most playful curious and active species of otter they have become a popular exhibit in zoos and aquaria but unwelcome on agricultural land because they alter river banks for access sliding and defense ,2
River otters eat a variety of fish and shellfish as well as small land mammals and birds,2
They grow to 1 m (3 to 4 feet) in length and weigh from 5 to 15 kg (10 to 30 pounds),2
In some areas this is a protected species and some places have otter sanctuaries which help ill and injured otters to recover,2
